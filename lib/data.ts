      "Dr. Ward is an absolutely phenomenal pediatrician! We have been seeing Dr. Ward the last 7 years (since our daughter was born), and have been impressed with her each and every time. She is extremely knowledgeable, kind, calm, and pragmatic. She is careful to check for all the possible things that could be behind symptoms, and makes excellent diagnoses. She is quick to prescribe medication when it’s truly needed, yet does not over-prescribe which we think is a great approach for our child. She is also incredibly responsive when we have urgent medical questions. Dr. Ward is also really great with kids - our daughter loves going to see her! In a nutshell, we feel incredibly lucky to have Dr. Ward as our pediatrician and we very highly recommend her to other families!!",
